Solar Panel Regulator
=====================
This program was created for a course at Algonquin College (ELN9204) to serve as a theoretical solar panel regulator.

### Setup
To compile it, you need to use a proprietary PIC C compiler by CCS. I compiled it with [version 5.012 on Arch Linux](https://aur.archlinux.org/packages/ccsc/). It will probably not compile under earlier versions.

### Usage
I don't expect this project to be actually used in production, so I'm not going to write out a manual. The code is up here mostly to help out myself and other students in the future as a reference.
